<div>As human uses of the ocean continue to grow in intensity and scale the need to manage impacts on vulnerable marine species, communities, &nbsp;habitats, and ecosystems (VSCHE) becomes more pressing. Unfortunately, even as legal and economic pressures to improve the management of VSCHE increase, there continue to be data gaps in our knowledge of their distribution and abundance. In data-poor regions, proxies for VSCHE are needed for predicting potential distributions and to aid precautionary decision making. Bathymetric proxies can be applied in any location with new worldwide bathymetric coverage. In this paper the utility of two bathymetric indices as proxies for VSCHE is explored using topographical roughness index and bathymetric position index in three different geographic settings with different spatial scales, types of biological data, and bathymetric resolutions. It was found that the bathymetric indices worked effectively as proxies for vulnerable species in general and, when combined with basic</div>
